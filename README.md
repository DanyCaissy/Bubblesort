# Bubblesort
Visual bubblesort simulator, the requirement for this project was that the sorting had to be done in the back-end, which explains why there is a back-end at all (a JavaScript-only implemented would have worked otherwise). Uses ajax and saves the state in the session. This project was completed in a few hours.
